# fundus_optic_neuropathy
Research on assistant diagnosis of fundus optic neuropathy based on deep learning 
This project is for sharing the code in the article.

First, use 0_file_separation.py to separate the files to train and test.
Second, in 1_main.py, you can change the models and hyperparameter.
After training, it will test the performance of the test file. And then, it will generate the CAMs.
Finally, you can use 2_fusion to see the fused images.
Because there's no data in origin file, you need to use the images of yourself.
